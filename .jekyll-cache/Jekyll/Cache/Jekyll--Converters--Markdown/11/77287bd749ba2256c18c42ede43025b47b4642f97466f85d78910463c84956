I"Ï<p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>John Gruber created the Markdown language in 2004 in collaboration with Aaron Swartz on the syntax, with the goal of enabling people ‚Äúto write using an easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format‚Äù. Its key design goal is readability. That the language be readable as-is.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To write using an easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To this end, its main inspiration is the existing conventions for marking up plain text in email, though it also draws from earlier markup languages, notably setext, Textile, and reStructuredText.</p>

<h2 id="markdown-flavours">Markdown Flavours</h2>

<p>There are several different versions of markdown</p>

<h3 id="commonmark">CommonMark</h3>

<p>From 2012, a group of people including Jeff Atwood and John MacFarlane launched what Atwood characterized as a standardization effort. A community website now aims to ‚Äúdocument various tools and resources available to document authors and developers, as well as implementors of the various markdown implementations‚Äù.</p>

<h3 id="github-flavored-markdown-gfm">GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)</h3>

<p>In 2017, GitHub released a formal specification of their GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) that is based on CommonMark. It follows the CommonMark specification exactly except for tables, strikethrough, autolinks and task lists, which the GitHub spec has added as extensions.</p>
